Now, I'm a student in the final year of my master's study at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

In addition, I also work as an intern in AWS Shanghai AI Lab, studying GNN & Transformer.

I'm interested in **Graph Neural Networks, FinTech, and Machine Learning System**.

I'm looking for a research position at an academic or commercial organization.
